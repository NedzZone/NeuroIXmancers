# HatchWell, Sensor Driven MR Rehab for Rotator Cuff Repair

HatchWell is a sensor driven physical therapy system for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair recovery. Using Meta Quest 3, Arduino EMG biosensors, and a mobile or web companion app, HatchWell turns painful PT into an engaging, trackable, and rewarding experience.

## About

Clinical focus, outpatient post op PT for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.  
Platform, Meta Quest 3 with hand tracking and mixed reality and XR Interaction Toolkit.  
Sensors, Arduino EMG for fatigue and pain related muscle signals.  
Companion app, built with Lovable for web and mobile.  
Design flows, Figma links below.

## Features

1. MR exercise tracking with hand reps and accuracy.  
2. Real time fatigue and pain bar from biosensor data.  
3. Companion app for patients and therapists.  
4. Progress logs, motivational feedback, and goal celebrations.
